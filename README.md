# BetterLoadSaveGame

An addon for Kerbal Space Program designed to improve the user interface for loading save games.

I was always frustrated with the in-game GUI for loading saved games, as it lists them in alphabetical order making it really hard to find the save you want when there's lots in the list. It also gets really slow to open once you have a lot of saves.

This mod attempts to fix that by:
* Listing the saves by creation time (descending)
* Including thumbnail screenshots

Looks like this:

## Installation

Available for install via CKAN.

Alternatively, download the latest release and extract the contents of the GameData folder into the GameData folder inside your KSP install.

## Usage

Press F7 in game to toggle the window on/off, and click on the buttons to load games.

Note for best screenshot quality, ensure "Texture Quality" is set to "Full Res" in your game options (under "Graphics").

## Recommended mods

Highly recommend also using a mod like [Dated Quick Saves](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97033-13122-magico13s-modlets-sensible-screenshot-dated-quicksaves-etc/) or [Kerbal Improved Save System](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138001-130-kiss-kerbal-improved-save-system/) to address my other favourite problem in the game of only having one quicksave slot when you press F5.

## Current state

Currently has basic features including screenshots, summary info, sorting and filtering.

I'm keen to make further improvements to it. If you have any ideas for new features or improvements, or if you find any bugs, please let me know!

In particular I'm not aware of any way to replace the official "Load Game" feature in the game menu, which is why you need to press a key (F7) to open the new dialog. If you have any idea how to fix this, please let me know.

An addon for Kerbal Space Program designed to improve the user interface for loading save games.

I was always frustrated with the in-game GUI for loading saved games, as it lists them in alphabetical order making it really hard to find the save you want when there's lots in the list. It also gets really slow to open once you have a lot of saves.

This mod attempts to fix that by:

	Listing the saves by creation time (descending)
	Including thumbnail screenshots
